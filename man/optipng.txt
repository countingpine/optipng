NAME
       OptiPNG  -  Advanced optimization program for Portable Network Graphics
       (PNG)

SYNOPSIS
       optipng [-? | -h | -help]
       optipng [options...] files...

DESCRIPTION
       OptiPNG is a PNG optimizer that recompresses image files to  a  smaller
       size  without  losing  any information.  In addition, this program per-
       forms a suite of useful  functions  like  integrity  checks,  meta-data
       recovery and pixmap-to-PNG conversion.

FILES
       The input files are image files of following types:

       - Native format: PNG.

       - External  pixmap  formats  (currently  supported:  GIF,  BMP, PNM and
       TIFF).

       OptiPNG processes each input file as follows:

       - If it is a PNG file:

              If it is possible to create an optimized version  of  the  given
              PNG  file,  the  optimized  file  replaces the original one. The
              original file can be backed up, at the user's option.

       - Otherwise (i.e. if it is an external pixmap format):

              An optimized PNG version of the given  image  file  is  created.
              The  output file name is created from the original file name and
              the .png extension.

       For example:

              optipng file1.png file2.gif

       will create an optimized file1.png and an  optimized  file2.png.   (The
       original  file1.png  is  replaced  by  the  optimized one; the original
       file2.gif is left intact.)

OPTIONS
   Basic options
       -?, -h, -help
              Show a complete summary of options.

       -o level
              Select the optimization level.
              Use -o0 to disable IDAT recompression trials.
              Use -o1 to enable a single IDAT recompression trial.
              Use a higher level to enable more trials (the higher the  level,
              the more trials).
              The  behavior  and  the  default  value  of this user option may
              change across different program versions. Use option -h  to  see
              the details pertaining to your specific version.

       -i type
              Select the interlace type (0-1).
              Use -i0 to produce a non-interlaced output.
              Use -i1 to produce an interlaced (Adam7) output.
              If this option is not used, the output will have the same inter-
              lace type as the input.

       -k, -keep
              Keep a backup of the modified file(s).
              The files that use the backup names prior to the program  execu-
              tion are not overwritten.

       -q, -quiet
              Run in quiet mode.

       -v     Run in verbose mode / Show copyright, version and build info.

   Advanced options
       -zc levels
              Select the zlib compression levels.
              The  behavior  and  the  default  value  of this user option may
              change across different program versions. Use option -h  to  see
              the details pertaining to your specific version.

       -zm levels
              Select the zlib memory levels.
              The  behavior  and  the  default  value  of this user option may
              change across different program versions. Use option -h  to  see
              the details pertaining to your specific version.

       -zs strategies
              Select the zlib compression strategies.
              The  behavior  and  the  default  value  of this user option may
              change across different program versions. Use option -h  to  see
              the details pertaining to your specific version.

       -zw window size
              Select the zlib window size (32k,16k,8k,4k,2k,1k,512,256).
              The window size can be specified either in bytes (e.g. 16384) or
              kilobytes (e.g. 16k).

       -f filters
              Select the PNG delta filters.
              The behavior and the default  value  of  this  user  option  may
              change  across  different program versions. The filter values 0,
              1, 2, 3, 4 correspond to the PNG standard filters  (None,  Left,
              Up,  Average and Paeth, respectively). The other values are used
              to specify adaptive filtering. Use option -h to see the  details
              pertaining to your specific version.

       -nb    Do not apply bit depth reduction.

       -nc    Do not apply color type reduction.

       -np    Do not apply palette reduction.

       -nz    Do not perform IDAT recompression (also disable reductions).

       -fix   Enable error recovery.

       -force Enforce  writing of a new output file.  Use this option to over-
              ride the program's decision not to write such  file,  e.g.  when
              the  PNG input is digitally signed (using dSIG), or when the PNG
              output becomes larger than the PNG input.

       -full  Produce a full report on IDAT.  This option might slow down  the
              trials.

       -preserve
              Preserve file attributes (time stamps, file access rights, etc.)
              where applicable.

       -simulate
              Run in simulation mode: perform the trials, but  do  not  create
              output files.

       -snip  Cut  one  image  out of multi-image, animation or video file(s).
              Depending on the input format, this may be either the  first  or
              the most relevant (e.g. the largest) image.

       -out file
              Write  output  file  to file.  The command line must not contain
              more than one input file.

       -dir directory
              Write output file(s) to directory.

       -log file
              Log messages to file.  For safety reasons, file  must  have  the
              extension .log.

       --     Stop option switch parsing.

   Notes
       The  option  names  are  case-insensitive  and can be abbreviated.  Any
       abbreviation must uniquely identify the full option name and must be no
       shorter  than  two  letters, unless one letter is explicitly permitted.
       For example, -quiet can be abbreviated as -q  or  -qu  (because  -q  is
       explicitly  mentioned in the list of possible options), while -preserve
       can be abbreviated as -pr but not as -p.

       Some options may have arguments that follow the option  name,  with  or
       without a whitespace used as a separator; e.g.

              -i1  <=>  -i 1
              -o3  <=>  -o 3

       Range arguments are cumulative; e.g.

              -f0 -f3-5  <=>  -f0,3-5
              -zs0 -zs1 -zs2-3  <=>  -zs0,1,2,3  <=>  -zs0-3

       The  zlib  window  size is automatically set to a minimum that does not
       affect the compression ratio.

       The output files will have all IDAT in  a  single  chunk,  even  if  no
       recompression is performed.

       Extremely exhaustive searches are not generally recommended.

EXAMPLES
       optipng file.png

       optipng -o5 file.png

       optipng -i1 -o7 -v -full -sim experiment.png -log experiment.log

BUGS
       Lossless  image  reductions are not completely implemented.  (This does
       NOT affect the integrity of the output files.)  Here  are  the  missing
       pieces:

              - The color palette reductions are implemented only partially.
              - The  bit  depth  reductions below 8, for grayscale images, are
              not implemented yet.

       TIFF support is limited to uncompressed, PNG-compatible (grayscale, RGB
       and RGBA) images.

       Metadata is not imported from the external image formats.
