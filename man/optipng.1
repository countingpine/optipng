.SH NAME
.B OptiPNG
\- advanced optimization program for
.B Portable Network Graphics (PNG)
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B optipng

.B optipng

.SH DESCRIPTION
.B OptiPNG
is a PNG optimizer that recompresses image files to a smaller size without
losing any information.
In addition, this program performs a suite of useful functions like integrity
checks, meta-data recovery and pixmap-to-PNG conversion.
.SH FILES
The input files are image files of following types:
.P
\- Native format: PNG.
.P
\- External pixmap formats (currently supported formats: GIF, BMP and PNM).
.P
.B OptiPNG
processes each input file as follows:
.P
\- If it is a PNG file:
.IP
If it is possible to create an optimized version of the given PNG file,
the optimized file replaces the original one. The original file can be
backed up, at the user's option.
.P
\- Otherwise (i.e. if it is an external pixmap format):
.IP
An optimized PNG version of the given image file is created.
The output file name is created from the original file name and the
\fC.png\fP extension.
.P
For example:
.IP
\fCoptipng file1.png file2.gif\fP
.P
will create an optimized \fCfile1.png\fP and an optimized \fCfile2.png\fP.
(The original \fCfile1.png\fP is replaced by the optimized one;
the original \fCfile2.gif\fP is left intact.)
.SH OPTIONS
.SS "Basic options"
.TP
\fB-?\fP, \fB\-h\fP, \fB\-help\fP
Show a complete summary of options.
.TP
\fB\-o\fP \fIlevel\fP
Select the optimization level.
.br
Use \fB\-o0\fP to disable IDAT recompression trials.
.br
Use \fB\-o1\fP to enable a single IDAT recompression trial.
.br
Use a higher \fIlevel\fP to enable more trials
(the higher the \fIlevel\fP, the more trials).
.br
The behavior and the default value of this user option may change across
different program versions. Use option \fB\-h\fP to see the details pertaining
to your specific version.
.TP
\fB\-i\fP \fItype\fP
Select the interlace type (0\-1).
.br
Use \fB\-i0\fP to produce a non-interlaced output.
.br
Use \fB\-i1\fP to produce an interlaced (\fIAdam7\fP) output.
.br
If this option is not used, the output will have the same interlace type as
the input.
.TP
\fB\-k\fP, \fB\-keep\fP
Keep a backup of the modified file(s).
.br
The files that use the backup names prior to the program execution are
\fInot\fP overwritten.
.TP
\fB\-q\fP, \fB\-quiet\fP
Run in quiet mode.
.TP
\fB\-v\fP
Run in verbose mode / Show copyright, version and build info.
.SS "Advanced options"
.TP
\fB\-zc\fP \fIlevels\fP
Select the zlib compression levels.
.br
The behavior and the default value of this user option may change across
different program versions. Use option \fB\-h\fP to see the details pertaining
to your specific version.
.TP
\fB\-zm\fP \fIlevels\fP
Select the zlib memory levels.
.br
The behavior and the default value of this user option may change across
different program versions. Use option \fB\-h\fP to see the details pertaining
to your specific version.
.TP
\fB\-zs\fP \fIstrategies\fP
Select the zlib compression strategies.
.br
The behavior and the default value of this user option may change across
different program versions. Use option \fB\-h\fP to see the details pertaining
to your specific version.
.TP
\fB\-zw\fP \fIwindow size\fP
Select the zlib window size (32k,16k,8k,4k,2k,1k,512,256).
.br
The window size can be specified either in bytes (e.g. 16384) or kilobytes
(e.g. 16k).
.TP
\fB\-f\fP \fIfilters\fP
Select the PNG delta filters.
.br
The behavior and the default value of this user option may change across
different program versions. The filter values 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 correspond to
the PNG standard filters (\fINone\fP, \fILeft\fP, \fIUp\fP, \fIAverage\fP
and \fIPaeth\fP, respectively). The other values are used to specify adaptive
filtering. Use option \fB\-h\fP to see the details pertaining to your specific
version.
.TP
\fB\-nb\fP
Do not apply bit depth reduction.
.TP
\fB\-nc\fP
Do not apply color type reduction.
.TP
\fB\-np\fP
Do not apply palette reduction.
.TP
\fB\-nz\fP
Do not perform IDAT recompression (also disable reductions).
.TP
\fB\-fix\fP
Enable error recovery.
.TP
\fB\-force\fP
Write a new output file, even if it is larger than the input file.
.TP
\fB\-full\fP
Produce a full report on IDAT.
This option might slow down the trials.
.TP
\fB\-log\fP \fIfile\fP
Append log messages to \fIfile\fP.
.TP
\fB\-preserve\fP
Preserve file attributes (time stamps, file access rights, etc.) where
applicable.
.TP
\fB\-simulate\fP
Run in simulation mode: perform the trials, but do not create output files.
.TP
\fB\-\-\fP
Stop option switch parsing
.SS "Notes"
The option names are case-insensitive and can be abbreviated.
Any abbreviation must uniquely identify the full option name and must be no
shorter than two letters, unless one letter is explicitly permitted. For
example, \fB\-quiet\fP can be abbreviated as \fB\-q\fP or \fB\-qu\fP, while
\fB\-preserve\fP can be abbreviated as \fB\-pr\fP but not as \fB\-p\fP.
.P
Some options may have arguments that follow the option name, with or without
a whitespace used as a separator; e.g.
.IP
\fCoptipng \-i1 \-o3 file.png  <=>  optipng \-i 1 \-o 3 file.png\fP
.P
Range arguments are cummulative; e.g.
.IP
\fC\-f0 \-f3\-5  <=>  \-f0,3\-5\fP
.br
\fC\-zs0 \-zs1 \-zs2\-3  <=>  \-zs0,1,2,3  <=>  \-zs0\-3\fP
.P
The zlib window size is automatically set to a minimum that does not affect the
compression ratio.
.P
The output file will have all IDAT in a single chunk, even if no recompression
is performed.
.P
Extremely exhaustive searches are not generally recommended.
