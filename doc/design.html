<h2>OptiPNG - Design decisions and rationale</h2>

<p>
Everyone is welcome to contribute to the development of OptiPNG.
This document provides useful information to the potential
contributors, but many pieces of advice given here may be followed
by any programmer.
</p>


<h3>Quality</h3>

<p>
Priority has been given to the following quality factors, in
decreasing order of importance:
</p>

<ol>
<li>
   <b>Correctness</b>
   <br>
   The most important goal is to produce PNG files that comply
   to the PNG specification. The code is written with great care,
   and it is tested extensively.
   However, if you do find defects, please report them to the
   author. (See the <code>README</code> file for contact info.)
</li>
<li>
   <b>Efficiency</b>
   <br>
   OptiPNG is designed to be fast. It needs to run a suite of
   brute-force trials, and the biggest amount of time is spent
   during zlib compression and decompression, and during I/O.
   This amount of time is reduced to a minimum:
   <ul>
   <li>
     No auxiliary I/O (i.e. no temporary files) is involved in
     the trials. Instead, the standard libpng I/O routines are
     redirected using
     <code>png_set_read_fn()</code>,
     <code>png_set_write_fn()</code>
     to a customized function
     <code>optipng_read_write_data()</code>
     that gathers the necessary statistics and writes the chunk
     data to a file only in the final optimization step.
   </li>
   <li>
     There is a single decompression step per file.
   </li>
   <li>
     The output file is recompressed only if the trials indicate
     that the file size will decrease.
   </li>
   <li>
     While it is still possible to further reduce the amount of
     time spent during trials (e.g. by estimating the compressed
     size without actually producing the compressed zlib stream),
     this cannot be achieved without breaking the encapsulation
     of the zlib library. Since correctness can be at risk, this
     aspect of efficiency has not been considered.
   </li>
   </ul>
</li>
<li>
   <b>Readability and maintainability</b>
   <br>
   [<i>"Premature optimization is the root of all evil."</i>
   - D.&nbsp;E.&nbsp;Knuth]
   <br>
   OptiPNG is not a simple application, even though the code is
   clear and well commented. It may be possible to optimize the
   code even more, and sacrifice some readability, by inlining
   functions manually, eliminating the overhead of the structured
   exception handling, etc. There is a strong word of caution
   against this, because the time spent in OptiPNG is minimal,
   and such gain is insignificant. No visible extra performance
   will be achieved, and readability will have much to suffer.
   <p>
   Furthermore, the code is ostensibly <i>not</i> polluted with
   pre-ANSI portability hacks like:
<pre>
#if defined(HAVE_STRING_H) || defined(STDC)
#include &lt;string.h&gt;
#endif
</pre>
   nor with hacks that depend on the availability of various
   supporting library features:
<pre>
#if PNG_FLOATING_POINT_SUPPORTED
   /* implement a certain application feature using the libpng
    * floating point routines
    */
#elif PNG_FIXED_POINT_SUPPORTED
   /* implement the same feature using the libpng fixed point
    * routines
    */
#else
   /* implement the same feature using hand-crafted code, or
    * do not implement it at all, crippling the application
    */
#endif
</pre>
   By using portability hacks, the build process is easier.
   However, two pieces of code that are expected to do the same
   thing are a source of problems, especially when the person who
   modifies them is not completely aware of the situation.
   It is much less painful to simply <i>require</i> the necessary
   library features:
<pre>
#ifndef PNG_FIXED_POINT_SUPPORTED
#error This program requires libpng with fixed point processing
#endif
</pre>
   The disadvantage of the latter approach is possibly a more
   inconvenient build process. The supporting library/libraries
   may have to be rebuilt and linked statically. This is a much
   smaller problem, though, and it is better to have a bloat of
   a few hundred kilobytes in the executable, instead of having
   a crippled program, or a program of lower quality.
</li>
<li>
   <b>Functionality</b>
   <br>
   OptiPNG serves its primary goal: to optimize the size of the
   given PNG files. Additional features, such as error recovery,
   or support for external image formats, have been implemented.
   When adding any new extra feature, it is important to preserve
   the level of other quality factors -- especially of those with
   a higher priority.
</li>
<li>
   <b>Portability</b>
   <br>
   <ul>
   <li>
     <b>Language and standard library</b>
     <br>
     The program is written in ANSI/ISO (Standard) C and requires
     the Standard C library. Since other quality factors have a
     higher priority, pre-ANSI C will never be supported. You can
     surely install a standards-compliant compiler for your
     platform.
     <br>
     System-specific file operations are supported by using
     system-specific library calls such as POSIX or Windows API,
     but these are not strictly required.
   </li>
   <li>
     <b>Machine</b>
     <br>
     The program is designed to run on any 32-bit machine.
     Porting the program to a 16-bit machine is feasible, but
     this should be done without sacrificing simplicity.
     Given the nature of the PNG optimization task, the program
     should not be run on old and slow machines, or on machines
     with limited memory.
     Of course, a 64-bit or better machine is more than welcome.
   </li>
   <li>
     <b>External dependencies/libraries</b>
     <br>
     Portability is one of the most important factors when
     developing software libraries, because it is difficult or
     impossible to control the applications that use established
     features. On the other hand, applications that are at the
     end of the dependency tree, such as OptiPNG, may take more
     liberal decisions for the benefit of other quality factors.
     In this case, the readability and maintainability are given
     a higher priority over portability.
   </li>
   </ul>
</ol>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<p>
The program usage is typical to the category of command-line
applications. There are some peculiarities, however, which are
enumerated below.
</p>

<ul>
<li>
  <b>Input and output file specification</b>
  <br>
  Given the nature of its task, it is difficult for OptiPNG to
  use the standard input and act as a program filter.
  We considered the following alternatives:
  <ol>
  <li>
     Explicit specification of the input files, which will be
     overwritten by the optimized output files.
<pre>
optipng input1.png input2.png input3.png
</pre>
     This behavior is similar to that of <code>compress</code>,
     <code>gzip</code> and other Unix utilities. At the user's
     option, the input is preserved in backup files.
     This approach is more natural to batch processing. It is
     easy, for example, to run OptiPNG in a WWW directory and
     optimize all the PNG files, leaving everything else in
     place.
     Another advantage resides in a higher processing speed, when
     the input file is already optimized. Instead of being copied
     to an identical output file, it is just left in place.
  </li>
  <li>
     Explicit specification of the input and output files:
<pre>
optipng input.png output.png
</pre>
     This may be more useful for experimentation purposes, but it
     is more onerous for the regular user. Running the program in
     batch mode is still possible, but that would require an
     alternate mode, such as:
<pre>
optipng -multi input1.png input2.png input3.png
optipng input1.png input2.png input3.png -dir outdir/
</pre>
     The disadvantages of this approach are the inconsistency
     between the two modes, and the difficulty to run the
     optimization in-place.
  </li>
  </ol>
  The first alternative serves the purpose better. Given that
  OptiPNG transforms the input losslessly, even the accidental
  omission of the backup option by the user does not lead to
  data loss.
</li>
<li>
  <b>Option specification</b>
  <br>
  The options are preceded by a single dash <code>'-'</code> and are
  case-insensitive. Single-letter options cannot be contracted;
  e.g.
<pre>optipng -k -q</pre>
  cannot be contracted to
<pre>optipng -kq</pre>
  This restriction eliminates the need to use a double dash when
  specifying a multi-character option, e.g. <code>-quiet</code>
  and <code>--quiet</code> are equivalent. Double-dashed
  option specification is used mainly as a compatibility hack
  in programs that used (and continue to use) option contraction.
  Even if newer programs use double-dashed option specification,
  with or without allowing contractions, this is not necessarily
  good style. Still, multiple dashes are accepted by OptiPNG.
  <p>
  (On a side note: while case sensitivity is useful in C, mainly
  to appease the name space pollution problems incurred by macro
  definitions, it is a mixed blessing in the Unix file system.
  If two file names are distinguished only by one or more capital
  letters, these names still say and mean the same thing. No good
  directory organization should have two such files in the same
  directory. From this point of view, the Windows approach where
  the letter case is retained, but the access is case-independent,
  is better.
  At least we are lucky that email addresses are case-insensitive...)
</li>
</ul>


<h3>File recovery</h3>

<p>
A regular PNG decoder may choose to stop the decoding process
whenever it detects integrity problems within the input. On the
other hand, at the user's option, OptiPNG can ignore non-fatal
errors and, in some particular instances, replace the invalid
input with corrected output. The correction is performed based
on simple, automatic decisions.
</p>


<h3>Compiler optimizations</h3>

<p>
It is essential for this program to run as fast as possible.
Here are some advices on how to adjust the compiler parameters in
order to obtain the best speed results, and still to maintain a
small size of the executable.
</p>

<ul>
<li>
  Compile the zlib library using the most aggressive set of
  optimizations, such as <code>"gcc -O3"</code>. Loop unrolling
  may also be enabled. Most of the time is spent by this code, and
  it is important to optimize it to the maximum extent possible.
  <br>
  <i>Note:</i> It may be necessary to profile the zlib code,
  to know the configuration that provides the best optimization.
  For example, too much inlining may cause cache penalties, and
  <code>"gcc -O2"</code> may work better than
  <code>"gcc -O3"</code> in some circumstances.
</li>
<li>
  Compile the libpng library and the OptiPNG source code using
  a set of optimizations that do not sacrifice the code size,
  such as <code>"gcc -O2"</code>. The speed of the OptiPNG program
  is determined by the speed of the compression and decompression
  routines (zlib), and the amount of time spent doing other tasks
  is insignificant, so this code needs not be inlined. Besides,
  too much inlining may increase the chance of cache penalty,
  with a negative effect on program execution.
</li>
<li>
  Remove the libpng features that are unnecessary for OptiPNG.
  This is possible by #defining <code>PNG_NO_XXX</code> macros
  when compiling libpng. Here are a few examples:
<pre>
#define PNG_NO_FLOATING_POINT_SUPPORTED     // not needed
#define PNG_NO_MNG_FEATURES                 // no MNG support
#define PNG_NO_SETJMP_SUPPORTED             // see "Exception handling"
#define PNG_NO_READ_TRANSFORMS
#define PNG_NO_WRITE_TRANSFORMS
</pre>
</li>
</ul>


<h3>Exception handling</h3>

<p>
It is unfortunate that C does not provide an exception handling
system, and the standard alternatives (returned error codes or
the setjmp mechanism) are many times unsatisfactory. Exception
handling is exceptionally useful to implementing recovery.
</p>

<p>
OptiPNG uses
<a href="http://www.nicemice.net/cexcept/">cexcept</a>,
an ultra-thin abstraction layer that
implements structured exception handling on top of the setjmp
mechanism. Essentially, this exception handling system
defines macros such as <code>Throw</code>, <code>Try</code> and
<code>Catch</code>, which are used by
OptiPNG. The multi-layered approach to throwing, catching and
re-throwing exceptions allows the program to continue with the
next file, even if fatal errors occur inside libpng. This allows
the source code to be much cleaner without a significant
performance overhead.
</p>

<p>
There are many issues pertaining to how the cexcept macros work,
and they can be read inside the <code>"cexcept.h"</code> file.
If OptiPNG or portions of it are ported to C++, it is strongly
recommended to use the native C++ exception handling instead.
