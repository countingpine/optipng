(known bugs, problems or limitations)


Legend
------
 - Minor bug, limitation, or incompletely-implemented feature.
 ! Bug that may lead to a behavior different than expected,
   but without any serious consequence.
!! Bug that may cause accidental data loss, security hazard,
   or another serious consequence.
 * Another problematic issue, that is not necessarily a bug.


Version 0.5.5   28-jan-2007
-------------
 - Lossless image reductions are not completely implemented.
   (This does NOT affect the integrity of PNG files.)
   Here are the missing pieces:
   - The color palette reductions are implemented only partially.
   - The bit depth reductions below 8, for grayscale images, are
     not implemented yet.
   - The gray(alpha)-to-palette reductions are not implemented yet.

 - BMP support is limited to uncompressed images.

 - TIFF support is limited to uncompressed, PNG-compatible
   (grayscale, RGB and RGBA) images.

 - Metadata is not imported from the external image formats.
