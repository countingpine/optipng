<h2>OptiPNG - The complete list of features</h2>

<p>
The main purpose of OptiPNG is to <i>optimize</i> PNG files, i.e.
to reduce their size to a minimum, without losing any information.
In order to achieve this goal, OptiPNG performs the following
tasks:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
  It losslessly reduces the bit depth, the color type and the
  color palette of the image.  This step reduces the size of the
  uncompressed image, which, indirectly, reduces the size of the
  compressed image (i.e. the size of the PNG file).
</li>
<li>
  It runs a suite of compression methods and strategies and
  selects the parameters that yield the smallest output file.
</li>
<li>
  It concatenates all the IDAT data in a single chunk, minimizing
  the overhead incurred by chunk headers and CRCs.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
In addition, OptiPNG has the following capabilities:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
  It offers a suite of optimization level presets.
  Given the number of trials that the user is willing to run,
  these presets will select the range of compression parameters
  that are most likely to yield the smallest output.
</li>
<li>
  It offers a high degree of freedom to advanced users who
  can choose among many kinds of compression parameters.
  The optimization level presets and the custom compression
  parameters may be used in any combination.
</li>
<li>
  It allows advanced users to disable certain image reductions.
</li>
<li>
  It corrects integrity errors found in the input files.
  Bad CRCs, invalid data in ancillary chunks, incomplete PNG
  files, or extraneous data in IDAT, are examples of such
  integrity errors.
</li>
<li>
  It recognizes several external file formats:
  <ul>
  <li>
    <b>BMP</b>
    <br>
    The reading capabilities are limited to uncompressed BMP
    files.  This is not a big problem, since few programs produce
    compresses BMPs.  On the other hand, it is easy to uncompress
    a BMP file, by opening it in a BMP processing program (such
    as MS Paint), and re-saving it uncompressed.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>GIF</b>
    <br>
    All static (i.e. non-animated) GIF images are supported.
    OptiPNG preserves the transparency information, but it
    does not preserve the textual comments embedded in GIFs.
    Animated GIFs cannot be converted to PNG.  Instead, only
    the first frame is converted, and a warning is issued.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>PNM (PBM, PGM, PPM)</b>
    <br>
    All these Unix-based formats are fully supported by OptiPNG.
    However, losslessness is only guaranteed when the maximum
    sample value is one of the following: 1, 3, 7, 15, 255, 65535.
    (This limitation applies to any PNM-to-PNG format converter,
    not only to OptiPNG.)
  </li>
  </ul>
</ul>
