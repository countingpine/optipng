(known bugs, problems, or limitations in the current version of OptiPNG)


Legend
------
 - Minor bug, limitation, or incompletely-implemented feature.
   Not dangerous.
 ! Bug that may cause OptiPNG to act differently than intended,
   but without causing accidental data loss.
   Inconvenient, but not dangerous.
!! Bug that may cause accidental data loss.
   Dangerous.
 * Another problematic issue, that is not necessarily a bug.


Version 0.4.5   31-may-2004
-------------
 * To avoid some bugs present in the latest libpng library
   (either libpng-1.0.15 or libpng-1.2.5), it is recommended to
   link OptiPNG statically to a patched version of libpng-1.0.15,
   supplied with the OptiPNG source distribution.
   (This is NOT a bug in OptiPNG itself.)
   When a newer, corrected libpng version will be officially
   released, this note will become obsolescent.
 - The color palette reductions are implemented only partially.
   (This does NOT affect the integrity of PNG files.)
 - The bit depth reductions below 8, for grayscale images, are
   not implemented yet.
 - The RGB(A)-to-palette reductions are not implemented yet.
