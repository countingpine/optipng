Changes since the last public release (1.2.35):

version 1.2.36 [May 7, 2009]

  Revised comments in png_set_read_fn() and png_set_write_fn().
  Revised order of #ifdef's and indentation in png_debug definitions of png.h
    bug introduced in libpng-1.2.34.
  Use png_memset() after png_malloc() of big_row_buf when reading an
    interlaced file, to avoid a possible UMR.
  Undid recent revision of PNG_NO_STDIO version of png_write_flush().  Users
    having trouble with fflush() can build with PNG_NO_WRITE_FLUSH defined.
  Revised libpng*.txt documentation about use of png_write_flush().
  Removed fflush() from pngtest.c.
  Added "#define PNG_NO_WRITE_FLUSH" to contrib/pngminim/encoder/pngusr.h
  Relocated misplaced PNG_1_0_X define in png.h that caused the prototype
    for png_set_strip_error_numbers() to be omitted from PNG_NO_ASSEMBLER_CODE
    builds.  This bug was introduced in libpng-1.2.15beta4.
  Added a section on differences between 1.0.x and 1.2.x to libpng.3/libpng.txt
  Fixed potential memory leak of "new_name" in png_write_iCCP() (Ralph Giles)
  Added "ifndef PNG_SKIP_SETJMP_CHECK" block in pngconf.h to allow
    application code writers to bypass the check for multiple inclusion
    of setjmp.h when they know that it is safe to ignore the situation.
  Renamed "user_chunk_data" to "my_user_chunk_data" in pngtest.c to suppress
    "shadowed declaration" warning from gcc-4.3.3.
  Renamed "gamma" to "png_gamma" in pngset.c to avoid "shadowed declaration"
    warning about a global "gamma" variable in math.h on some platforms.
